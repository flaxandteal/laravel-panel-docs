##Thank you for considering contributing to the LaravelPanel!

LaravelPanel is an open source project with a very diverse community, where people from all over the world contribute their work, with everyone benefitting from friendly help and advice, and kindly helping others in return.

##Bug Reports

To encourage active collaboration, LaravelPanel strongly encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. "Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing a failing test.

However, if you file a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.

The LaravelPanel source code is managed on [Github](https://github.com/serverfireteam/panel)
